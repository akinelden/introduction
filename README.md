## Undergraduate Projects

### IE440 Nonlinear Models in Operations Research
The topic of the lecture is nonlinear optimization techniques in one and multi dimensional space.

#### [ie440-homework1](github.com/akinelden/ie440-homework1)
4 different heuristics methods are implemented to find local minimum in one dimension.

#### [ie440-homework2](github.com/akinelden/ie440-homework2)
4 different location-allocation problems are solved using analytical solution and heuristics.
